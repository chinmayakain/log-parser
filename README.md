# Welcom to Log Parser! ðŸ‘‹


## About

> A log parser application with a backend built using Node.js and TypeScript that converts a log file in a specific format to a JSON file. The log file format includes a timestamp, log level, transaction ID, and log information. The frontend, built using React and Tailwind CSS, provides a UI for uploading the log file and downloading the parsed JSON file. The UI includes a button for uploading the file and an alert to show API error messages. The build tool used is Vite.
